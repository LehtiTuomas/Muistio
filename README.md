Note taking app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Yet another note-taking app. The app will store all notes to the browser's local storage and retrieve them on startup. This was a very fun project and helped me to better understand the usage of functions, arrays and objects. It also gave me a lot of practice on DOM-manipulation.
